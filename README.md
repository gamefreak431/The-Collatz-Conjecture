# The-Collatz-Conjecture

I was inspired by [this YouTube short](https://youtube.com/shorts/8fNFd2Xswjs?si=NawGKWkkiFNhFAWM) by Veritasium.

I was in bed scrolling when I saw it and my first thought was _"I can write this in JavaScript"_ and I had the algorithm written in a few minutes in the code playground on [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/). Since then I built out a website to demonstrate 3x+1 which was a great project for learning. 

I learned:
1. Using the DOM.
2. Writing more readable code.
3. Flexbox and how much I hate CSS
4. Responsive design (just enough to not make it not look like total trash on mobile)
5. How to review my own code and refactor it.
6. Event listeners.
7. Using Github Pages for something other than a blog.
8. Git rebase.
9. Git commits and when to make them.

Most of the CSS I grabbed from [Coding2GO](https://www.youtube.com/@coding2go) and their video on [Responsive Web Design](https://youtu.be/2IV08sP9m3U?si=Wn9DusvtkvmYssjk) so thanks to them for making this site look pretty. 

You'll see there's two branches: Original and Main.

Original is the last time I worked on this project six months ago. I wanted to pick it up again and publish it after this time because I've learned a lot more since then. Also to demonstrate to myself that I can read my own code and understand what's going on with it. To that end, I may have gone a little overboard with documentation in the code but it was super helpful when I came back to this project so I guess it worked out.

Main is my refactor based on that six months of learning and the branch that is published to [GitHub Pages](https://gamefreak431.github.io/The-Collatz-Conjecture/)
